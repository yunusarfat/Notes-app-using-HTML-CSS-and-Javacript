Notes App

A simple web-based notes app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, which are saved in the browser's localStorage for persistence. The app uses CSS for styling and provides an intuitive interface for managing notes. Refreshing the page won't delete your notes; they are automatically saved and restored.
